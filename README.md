# Linear Camera Vision Soft
## Introduction

This repo includes a code for linear camera connection and camera image processing.
With using this code you can provide stable continuous connectivity between PC and camera to get "line" images and then stitch them to one image or video sequence.
After getting final image or video (even in real-time mode) you can analyse the result with OpenCV filtering or other ways to detect different objects / kinds of objects and work with them in the way you want.

## Installation

Download repo and install the dependencies using the following commands:

```
